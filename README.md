> Hero of the Spiral is an MMORPG in which the player takes on the role of a young hero, traveling through the Spiral. The battles are turn-based. The player can choose between several classes, which ultimately share a huge skill tree. Thus, the player can create and train his character according to his senses. The game is inspired by *[Path of Exile](https://www.pathofexile.com/)* and *[Wizard101](https://de.wizard101.gameforge.com/wizard101/de/game)*.
